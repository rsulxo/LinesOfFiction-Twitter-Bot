    "Courage does not always roar. Valor does not always shine.",
    "One day, you will be old enough to start reading fairytales again.",
    "Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited to all we know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand.",
    "Do not be silent. Raise your voice. Be a light in the dark."
